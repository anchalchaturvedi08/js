## 🟢 **Step 2: Variables in JavaScript**

### 🔹 What is a variable?

A **variable** is like a **container** that stores data (like a name, number, etc.) which we can use later.

Think of it like this:

📦 *You label a box as "name" and put "Anchal" inside it.*

## 🔸 How to create a variable in JavaScript?

There are **3 ways**:

```javascript
var name = "Anchal";   // old way (avoid in modern JS)
let age = 21;          // recommended
const country = "India"; // constant value, cannot change
```

> For interviews:
> ✅ Always prefer `let` and `const`.
> ❌ Avoid `var` (because of hoisting issues and scope confusion).

### 🔹 Example:

```javascript
let firstName = "Anchal";
let age = 21;
const gender = "Female";

console.log(firstName); // Output: Anchal
console.log(age);       // Output: 21
console.log(gender);    // Output: Female
```

## 🔍 Deep Explanation:

| Keyword | Can reassign value? | Can redeclare? | Scope         |
| ------- | ------------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| `var`   | ✅ Yes               | ✅ Yes          | Function-wide |
| `let`   | ✅ Yes               | ❌ No           | Block-level   |
| `const` | ❌ No (constant)     | ❌ No           | Block-level   |

### ✅ Interview Tip:

> 🔹 **Q: What is the difference between `let` and `const`?**
> **A:**
>
> * Use `let` when the value might change.
> * Use `const` when the value should **not change**.
> * Both are **block-scoped** (limited to `{ }` block).
